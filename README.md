This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$unwind` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The error occurs when joining with a collection that might be empty.  The solution shows how to handle this using the `$ifNull` operator to gracefully manage empty collections. This repository shows how to prevent unexpected errors during aggregation and data processing in MongoDB.
